Combinations

nCr = n!/(n-r)!*r!

- Selecting r items from n items.
- Order doesn't matter.
{1,2,3} == {2,1,3}

- nCr = nC(n-r)
Selecting r items = rejecting n-r items.

- nC0 = nCn = nC1 = 1

- n-1Cr-1 + n-1Cr = nCr
Not selecting 1st item + Selecting 1st item = Selecting r items including 1st item.

Permutations

nPr = n!/(n-r)!

- Selecting and arranging r items from n items.
- Order matters.
(1,2,3) != (2,1,3)

- nPn = N!
